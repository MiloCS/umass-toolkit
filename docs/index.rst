UMass APIs
==========

This website maintains documentation for various APIs serving up data relating
to the `University of Massachusetts Amherst <https://www.umass.edu/>`_. It also
hosts documentation for umass-python, a Python 3 library that makes it easy to
use these APIs in your Python projects, and that serves as a reference
implementation of sorts to aid efforts to use these APIs in other languages.
